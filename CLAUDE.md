# Claude Agent Context

This project uses AGENTS.md as the canonical source of agent rules.

Before answering or generating code:

- read AGENTS.md
- follow its constraints, documentation rules, and workflows

If a task depends on documentation, versions, or external services,
follow the Documentation and Sources Rule defined in AGENTS.md.

When unsure, ask questions instead of guessing.
